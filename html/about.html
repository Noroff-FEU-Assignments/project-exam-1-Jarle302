        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This blog is made as my exam project first year studying front end
          development at noroff. I could make a blog about anything, i decided
          to create a automatic blog, so i first made a backend app that creates
          blog posts and makes images that fits the content without having to be
          manually prompted.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          The blog is generating the posts using openAis api, where it gets
          prompted to create a blog post, then parts of the posts are
          dynamically used to create images that fits the text again using open
          Ais api, which then posts the post to wordpress which is used as a
          headless cms, in the end the front end is fetching the posts from the
          wordpress api and displaying them as a blog. The backend is set on a
          timer, to create a new post every day
